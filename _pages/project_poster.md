The next main deliverable for the final project is the project poster to be presented on May 30. Being present for the poster session is mandatory for on-campus students. 
The poster should be modeled after a standard scientific/technical poster. 
You should print out your poster (try to do this early!) but I would also like an electronic (pdf) copy to be submitted to me via email as well. This should be submitted by 11:59pm, May 28,.

The poser will be graded out of 15 possible points, which will be assigned as follows.  
  
### Poster quality \[5 points\]  
  
The poster should  
  
- have a clear title and list of project team members,  
  
- be visually appealing and professional,  
  
- be easily readable from 4 feet away (use a large font!),  
  
- make use of visuals to enhance the information,  
  
- be free from typos/errors,  
  
- clearly convey the results of the project in a way that is accessible to anyone in the class.  
  
### Presentation quality \[5 points\] 
  
As a presenter, you should  
  
- be able to describe the project in a quick summary of 30 seconds or less,  
  
- be able to provide a more detailed description that goes through the entire poster in less than 5 minutes,  
  
- present your poster in a clear/organized/understandable manner,  
  
- speak clearly and distinctly,  
  
- be able to coherently respond to questions.  
  
### Technical contents \[5 points\]  
  
Finally, your poster/presentation should address  
  
- the motivation for why you selected the particular problem you chose,  
  
- a sufficient amount of background information so that anyone in the class will be able to understand what you did,  
  
- a high-level description of your technical approach, highlighting why your approach is appropriate and any particularly creative/original aspects to your work,  
  
- what you have accomplished (so far),  
  
- details such as how you selected any unknown parameters and how you dealt with validation/evaluation of your algorithm,  
  
- **indications of which team member(s) were responsible for which portions of the project.**
