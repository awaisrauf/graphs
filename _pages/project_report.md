## 3. Final project report 
___  

  
The final report for the project should be submitted by 11:59pm, May 18 (together with the pdf copy of your poster). The report and the poster should be emailed to ali.ahmed@itu.edu.pk as attachments. The report must be single-spaced with a font-size of 12pt or higher, margins no smaller than 1 inch, and can be a maximum of 6 pages including figures and references. I will read/grade only the first 6 pages of whatever you send me, so do not exceed this limit. If you have accomplished a lot, it may sound difficult to fit everything into this page limit, but 6 pages is already a lot more than you will often get, and concisely summarizing the result of a complex project is a tremendously important skill. Also, if you can say everything in fewer pages, that is all the better. There is no page minimum.  
  
The final report must contain the following elements.  
  
> **Project summary**  
  
> Using a maximum of one page, the first page of your final report should summarize the project by clearly indicating what you accomplished. You should include sufficient background so that anyone taking this class should be capable of understanding (at a high-level) what the problem is, why it is interesting, and what you ultimately did. (Note: You do not have to devote the entire first page to this summary. Your detailed description can start on the first page after the summary if you would like.)  
  
> **Detailed description:**  
  
> The rest of the report should provide a detailed description of the project including an introduction/motivation, background for the problem, technical details of the approach taken, results, and discussion/conclusions. The detailed description should also include, either as a separate section or integrated into the writeup, an indication of which team member(s) were primarily responsible for which portions of the project.  
  
The final report will be graded out of 15 possible points, which will be assigned as follows.  
  
#### Professionalism \[3 points\]

#### Overall writing quality \[3 points\]  
  
- Is the report clear and easy to read?

#### Technical merit \[9 points\]  
  
- What is the overall quality of the work performed for the project?  
  
- Is the problem particularly novel/interesting?
